## Technologies
### Plain HTML/CSS
* No JS needed

### W3.CSS
A lightweight CSS Framework I use in most of my projects is [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/). W3.CSS is free to use. No license is necessary.

### GitHub Actions
I use a GitHub workflow to automatically deploy the masters head to firebase. The script for that purpose is located in this repo under [.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/Stousn/ergotherapie-bankler.at/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
